Released Check 0.6.1
Bug fix for srunner_failures (bad version actually returned all results), added srunner_results to do what srunner_failures used to do, and added corrected unit tests for both.

Also changed the API for reporting the number of failed tests from srunner_nfailed to srunner_ntests_failed, to harmonized better with new function srunner_ntests_run. This unfortunately may break some unit tests slightly -- that's why the major release number is 0 :-)
