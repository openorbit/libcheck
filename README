Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface
for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the
developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can
catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation
faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within
source code editors and IDEs.

See http://check.sourceforge.net/ for more information, including a
tutorial.

To install, read the directions in INSTALL.

If you get Check out of CVS, you will need a working setup of automake
(at least version 1.9.6) and autoconf (at least version 2.59) in order
to successfully build Check.

Just do

$ autoreconf --install

in this directory to set everything up, and then call configure as
usual.

autoreconf calls all of the necessary tools for you, like autoconf,
automake, autoheader, etc.  If you ever change something during
development, run autoreconf again (without --install), and it will
perform the minimum set of actions necessary.

If you want to build the documentation, you need a docbook2html
script, which is provided by either docbook-utils or sgml2x.  It is
also available online at check.sourceforge.net.
