Build issues:
-------------

convert check to use libtool
figure out if we need stamp-h.in or not
use AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4]) and create an m4/ dir for check.m4
  aclocaldir = $(datadir)/aclocal
  aclocal_DATA = mymacro.m4 myothermacro.m4

  ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4  # put in top-level Makefile.am

fix overriding CFLAGS in configure.ac
use AC_DEFINE to define version number stuff?
change MICRO to ALPHA?
add std-options to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
investigate subdir-objects option to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
use filename-length-max=99 in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

just make sure libcheck.a works as a dependency, don't call $(MAKE)

Using

     SUBDIRS = lib src . test

will cause lib/ to be built before src/, then the current directory
will be built, finally the test/ directory will be built. It is
customary to arrange test directories to be built after everything
else since they are meant to test what has been constructed.
