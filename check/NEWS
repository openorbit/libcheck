Released Check 0.7.0

Included a primitive logging function (at the moment, it only prints a
copy of the CRVERBOSE output to the log file), added the ability for
an SRunner to run multiple suites (and reorganized the Check tests to
take advantage of that), and added the magic to allow Check to be used
with C++.

Also added Doxygen markup to the header file, but I'm not terribly
satisfied withe clarity of the output. I may switch to CWEB... Next
release should include API docs and improved logging, if nothing else
comes up...

Released Check 0.6.1

Bug fix for srunner_failures (bad version actually returned all
results), added srunner_results to do what srunner_failures used to
do, and added corrected unit tests for both.

Also changed the API for reporting the number of failed tests from
srunner_nfailed to srunner_ntests_failed, to harmonized better with
new function srunner_ntests_run. This unfortunately may break some
unit tests slightly -- that's why the major release number is 0 :-)
