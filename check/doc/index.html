    <H1>Check: A unit test framework for C</H1>
    
    <P>Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple
    interface for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of
    the developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check
    can catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause
    segmentation faults or other signals. The output from unit tests
    can be used within source code editors and IDEs..</P>
    
    <P>Check was inspired by similar frameworks that currently exist
    for most programming languages; the most famous example being
    JUnit for Java ( <A HREF="www.junit.com">www.junit.com</A>
    ). There is a list of unit test frameworks for multiple languages
    at
      <A

      . Unit testing has a long history as part of formal quality
    assurance methodologies, but has recently been associated with the
    lightweight methodology called Extreme Programming. In that
    methodology, the characteristic practice involves interspersing
    unit test writing with coding (" test a little, code a little"
    ). While the incremental unit test/code approach is indispensable
    to Extreme Programming, it is also applicable, and perhaps
      indispensable, outside of that methodology.
    <P>The incremental
      test/code approach provides three main benefits to the developer:
    <P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Because the unit tests use the interface to the unit being
      tested, they allow the developer to think about how the
      interface should be designed for usage early in the coding
      process.</LI>
      
      <LI>They help the developer think early about aberrant cases,
      and code accordingly.</LI>

      <LI>By providing a documented level of correctness, they allow
      the developer to refactor (see <A
      HREF="http://www.refactoring.com">www.refactoring.com</A> )
      aggressively.</LI>
      
    </OL>
    
    <P>That third reason is the one that turns people into unit
    testing addicts. There is nothing so satisfying as doing a
    wholesale replacement of an implementation, and having the unit
    tests reassure you at each step of that change that all is
    well. It is like the difference between exploring the wilderness
    with and without a good map and compass: without the proper gear,
    you are more likely to proceed cautiously and stick to the marked
    trails; with it, you can take the most direct path to where you
    want to go.<P>
