===========================

This version of check makes tcase_free and suite_free static and not 
available to your programs anymore. this is not an error, but intended
since these are freed by srunner_free now. a deprecation period would 
have been nice, but here we are. so: just delete the calls and make 
sure you run srunner_free!
