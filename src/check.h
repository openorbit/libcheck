/*! \mainpage Check: a unit test framework for C

\section overview Overview
Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within source code editors and IDEs.

\section quickref Quick Reference

\subsection creating Creating

\par
Unit tests are created with the #START_TEST/#END_TEST macro pair. The #fail_unless and #fail macros are used for creating checks within unit tests; the #mark_point macro is useful for trapping the location of signals and/or early exits.

\subsection managing Managing test cases and suites

\par
Test cases are created with #tcase_create, unit tests are added with #tcase_add_test
\par
Suites are created with #suite_create, freed with #suite_free; test cases are added with #suite_add_tcase

\subsection running Running suites

\par
Suites are run through an SRunner, which is created with #srunner_create, freed with #srunner_free. Additional suites can be added to an SRunner with #srunner_add_suite.

\par
Use #srunner_run_all to run a suite and print results.
